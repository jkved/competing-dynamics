# competing-dynamics
My Monte-Carlo numerical experiments on competing dynamics Ising model. Usual spin models are driven by single type of dynamics - Metropolis or Kawasaki. This is an attempt to reproduce some scientific results on competing dynamics where these two processes occur simultaneously. It is different type of modelling as other "competing" dynamics usually employ further competing interactions, i.e. involing more interactions with further neighbours.

I wrote the code in C++ for speedier calculations than Python ones. I also attach here my research thesis for 2022-2023 autumn semester on this topic (in Lithuanian) and an abstract submitted on this topic to OpenReadings 2023 conference.
